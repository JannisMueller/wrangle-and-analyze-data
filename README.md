# wrangle-and-analyze-data
In this project, I gathered, assessed, and cleaned data  and then acted on it through analysis (visualization and regression modeling). The dataset is from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs

You can find the whole project in the Jupyter Notebook.
I also added a html file of the project since it is difficult to see diffs on notebooks and do code reviews.

Furthermore, I added a wrangle report and and an act report.

*wrangle report*: documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean

*act report*: documentation of analysis and insights into final data

Since the notebook displays every line of ouput from the Twitter API query, there is some scrolling needed in the gather process.

# Installation
