# wrangle-and-analyze-data
In this project, I gathered, assessed, and cleaned data  and then acted on it through analysis (visualization and regression modeling). The dataset is from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs

You can find the whole project in the Jupyter Notebook.

Since the notebook displays every line of ouput from the Twitter API query, there is some scrolling needed in the gather process.
