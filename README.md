# wrangle-and-analyze-data
In this project, I gathered, assessed, and cleaned data  and then acted on it through analysis (visualization and regression modeling). The dataset is from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs

You can find the whole project in the Jupyter Notebook.
I also added a html file of the project since it is difficult to see diffs on notebooks and do code reviews.

Since the notebook displays every line of ouput from the Twitter API query, there is some scrolling needed in the gather process.

# Installation
Clone the repository and open the file in Jupyter Notebook
